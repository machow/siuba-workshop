### Exercise 1: inspecting music data

Try changing to "United States".
This should return only the top 200 hits from the United States.


```{python}
(music_top200
  >> filter(_.country == "Mexico")
)
```

Which artist has a track in the second position on the United States charts?

<details><summary>Roddy Ricch</summary>Try again. That artist is in the first position.</details>
<details><summary>Lil Uzi Vert</summary>That's right!</details>
<details><summary>Halsey</summary>Try again. That artist is the second from last position (198).</details>


### Exercise 2: inspecting `track_features` data

Use the options below, to examine tracks by different artists. Can you find the options that order tracks from highest energy to lowest?

```{python}
# The Weeknd
# Bad Bunny
# Roddy Ricch
# Justin Bieber
#_.popularity
#-_.popularity
#_.energy
#-_.energy
(track_features
  >> arrange(-_.popularity)
  >> filter(_.artist == "The Weeknd")
)
```


### Exercise 3: Plotting track features

Here is one kind of plot you will learn to make in the course.

```{python}
#        - popularity
#        - acousticness
#        - danceability
(track_features
  >> filter(_.artist == "The Weeknd")
  >> ggplot(aes("energy", "valence", size = "popularity", color = "album", label = "track_name"))
    + geom_point()
    + geom_text(nudge_y = .05, size = 10)
)
```
