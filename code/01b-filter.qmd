### Exercise 1: 

The code below is filtering to keep only hits where `country` is United States.
Change the filter to get hits from Canada.

```{python}
(music_top200
  >> filter(_.country == "United States")
)
```

```{python}
#| tags: [solution-code]
(music_top200
  >> filter(_.country == "Canada")
)
```

<prompt-expandable header="Comparing results, which artist is in the top 3 in both (the) United States and Canada?">

<q-multiple-choice>
  <q-opt text="Roddy Ricch"><span>Nailed it!</span></q-opt>
  <q-opt text="The Weeknd"><span>That artist is only top 3 in the United States</span></q-opt>
  <q-opt text="Tones And I"><span>That artist is only top 3 in the Canada</span></q-opt>
</q-multiple-choice>

</prompt-expandable>

### Exercise 2: 

* Filter to keep tracks where position equals 5.

```{python}
(music_top200
  >> filter(___)
)
```

```{python}
#| tags: [solution-code]
(music_top200
  >> filter(_.position == 5)
)
```

<prompt-expandable header="Which artist is in position 5 in South Africa?">

<q-multiple-choice>
  <q-opt text="Bad Bunny"><span></span></q-opt>
  <q-opt text="Eminem"><span>That's right!</span></q-opt>
  <q-opt text="BTS"><span></span></q-opt>
  <q-opt text="Selena Gomes"><span></span></q-opt>  
</q-multiple-choice>

</prompt-expandable>

### Exercise 3:

Find the top 5 songs in Hong Kong.

In the slides we discussed the `==` operator. Here is a longer list of some options!

| operator | meaning |
| -------- | ------- |
| `==`     | is equal to |
| `<`      | is less than |
| `>`      | is greater than |

```{python}
(music_top200
  >> filter(___, ___)
)
```

```{python}
#| tags: [solution-code]
(music_top200
  >> filter(_.country == "Hong Kong", _.position < 6)
)
```

### Exercise 4: looking at The Weeknd's streams

How many times has The Weeknd had over 1,000,000 streams?

<details>
    <summary>Hint:</summary>
    Do in steps. Run first to get all rows where the artist is The Weeknd, and then modify your code to get where he has over 1,000,000 streams.

```{python}
#| tags: [solution-code]
(music_top200
  >> filter(_.artist == "The Weeknd", _.streams > 1000000)
)
