```{python}
from setup import *
from setup import ___, _
```

import slides from '../slides/02c-slides.markdown'

<RevealSlides :slides="slides" />

The plot below shows all top 200 hundred hits for Eric Chou across countries. 
Use the code cell below to recreate it.

(Note: running the code won't delete the plot!).

```{python}
# your code here



#
```

```{python}
#| tags: [hide-input]
(music_top200
  >> filter(_.artist == "Eric Chou")
  >> ggplot(aes("position", "streams", color = "country"))
   + geom_point()
   + labs(title = "Top 200 hits for Eric Chou across countries")
)
```

### Exercise 2:

Use plots of the data for the artists Snelle, Bazzi, and Davyi, to answer the questions below.

You may need to write and run code multiple times, and produce multiple plots.

```{python}
(
    
)
```

```{python}
#| tags: [solution-code]
p1 = (music_top200
  >> filter(_.artist.isin(["Snelle", "Bazzi", "Dayvi"]))
  >> ggplot(aes("position", "streams", color = "country"))
   + geom_point()
   + facet_wrap("~artist")
)

p2 = (music_top200
  >> filter(_.artist.isin(["Snelle", "Bazzi", "Dayvi"]))
  >> ggplot(aes("position", "streams", color = "continent"))
   + geom_point()
   + facet_wrap("~artist")
)

print(p1, p2)
```

Which of these artists have hit tracks in the most continents?

<details><summary>Snelle</summary>Incorrect. Did you try using the color aesthetic?</details>
<details><summary>Bazzi</summary>That's right. Bazzi has hits on every continent.</details>
<details><summary>Dayvi</summary>Incorrect. Did you try using the color aesthetic?</details>

How many *countries* does Dayvi have hit tracks in?

<details><summary>1</summary>Incorrect.</details>
<details><summary>2</summary>That's right.</details>
<details><summary>3</summary>Incorrect.</details>
