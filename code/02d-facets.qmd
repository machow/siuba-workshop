### Exercise 1: 

**TODO**

### Exercise 2:

Below is the start of plotnine's documentation for `facet_wrap`. 


<img src="../assets/facet_wrap_docs.png" style="width: 100%;">

Notice that the Parameters section lists `ncol` and `nrow` options. These determine how many columns or rows to use. For example, the plot below has `nrow = 1`.

Try out the plot as is, and with the `nrow` argument changed to `ncol = 1`.
Then, answer the questions below.

```{python}
# This code keeps the 3 artists listed ----
artists_to_keep = ["Billie Eilish", "ITZY", "Roddy Ricch"]

some_artists = (
  track_features
  >> filter(_.artist.isin(artists_to_keep))
)

# This code plots the data ----
(some_artists
  >> ggplot(aes("energy", "valence", color = "artist"))
   + geom_point()
   + facet_wrap("~artist", nrow = 1)
   + labs(title = "Song features across 3 artists")
)
```

Which of the three artists tends to have the lowest valence?

<details><summary>Billie Eilish</summary>Correct! We'll discuss how to measure the idea of "tends to have" in the next chapter.</details>
<details><summary>ITZY</summary>That's not right. This artist tends to have the highest valence.</details>
<details><summary>Roddy Ricch</summary>That's not right. Look for the cluster of points toward the bottom of the plot.</details>

Which value seems easier to compare across facets, when ncol is set to 1?

<details>
<summary>answer</summary>
    
This is subjective, but I would say energy is easier to compare, since there is only one x-axis for across all plots. (For example, there is a only one spot on the x-axis where energy is .25).
