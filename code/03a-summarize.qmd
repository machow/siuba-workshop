### Exercise 1:

The code below calculates the average duration.

* Uncomment the summarize verb.
* Change it to calculate median duration.
* Make sure to change the resulting column name to indicate its a median.

```{python}
(music_top200
  #>> summarize(avg_duration = _.duration.mean())
)
```

```{python}
#| tags: [solution-code]
(music_top200
  >> summarize(median_duration = _.duration.median(), ttl_streams = _.streams.sum())
)
```

What is the median duration?

<details><summary>205.990</summary>Incorrect</details>
<details><summary>65.631</summary>Incorrect</details>
<details><summary>201.084</summary>That's right!</details>
<details><summary>851.871</summary>Incorrect</details>

Add a second argument to summarize, which calculates the sum of streams. How large is it?

<details><summary>30,182,252</summary>Incorrect</details>
<details><summary>301,822,525</summary>That's right!</details>
<details><summary>451,822,525</summary>Incorrect</details>
<details><summary>45,182,252</summary>Incorrect</details>

### Exercise 2:

Use verbs you learned in chapter 1 to do the following:

* find the track with the lowest duration
* subset the data to keep only the row for that track

(Note, you may need to run code multiple times)

```{python}
(music_top200

)
```

Now, use summarize to calculate the min duration, and the max duration directly.

```{python}
(music_top200

)
```

Why would you use summarize like this, rather than the arrange and filter approach?

<details><summary>The min and max values might be in different observations (rows).</summary>That's right. Filter keeps specific rows, but summarize can collect values from across rows.</details>
<details><summary>It keeps more of the original data.</summary>Try again. Filter keeps all the variables (columns), while summarize will remove most of them.</details>
<details><summary>The arrange and filter approach can do anything summarize can.</summary>Try again.</details>

### Exercise 3:

The examples below show what happens verbs like filter and mutate use methods like `.mean()`.

```{python}
# create column for average streams
(music_top200
  >> mutate(avg_streams = _.streams.mean())
)
```

```{python}
# keep observations where streams are above average
(music_top200
  >> filter(_.streams < _.streams.mean())
)
```

Based on the examples above, can you use only the filter verb to get the most streamed song in all the data?

```{python}
# modify the filter verb below

(music_top200
  >> filter()
)
```

```{python}
(music_top200
  >> filter(_.streams == _.streams.max())
)
```
